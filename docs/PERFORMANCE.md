# Battery and performance rules

Rules for every change to the app (app/). The tests in app/test/battery.test.mjs check the ones a machine can check.
Written 25 Oct 2026 after the battery, smoothness and iOS audit (report: files/qa-25oct/C-perf-report.md on the build box).

## Battery

1. **No bare timers that repeat.** `setInterval` is not used in src/ or platform/ (a test fails if it comes back).
   Repeating work goes through src/lib/activity.ts:
   * `useScreenPoll(run, everyMs)` for a screen: runs only while the app is in front AND the screen is on view.
     A screen under another one in the stack, a tab you left, a locked phone: no timer, no request.
   * `startAppPoll(run, everyMs)` for app wide jobs (alerts poll, live trip engine, iPhone trip card refresh):
     runs only while the app is in front. Call `setEnabled(false)` when there is nothing to do (no trip).
   * `useNow(ms)` for countdowns: ticks only while the screen is on view and the app is in front, on whole
     multiples of the clock. Default 5 s (countdowns show whole minutes). Do not pass 1000.
2. **Back off on failure.** A poll job returns `false` (or throws) when it failed; the wait then doubles each time,
   up to 5 minutes, and resets after a success or a pull to refresh. Never retry in a tight loop.
3. **Catch up once.** Coming back to the app or the screen runs a stale job once at once, never once per missed tick.
4. **Gaps in use today:** trip list batches only on scroll near the end or a pull at the top (at most 8 later and 3 earlier per visit, one at a time, stopped at 4am, never while the screen is off view), departures and trip results 15 to 20 s, live trip engine 15 s, iPhone trip card 30 s,
   alerts poll 20 s (60 s when the phone has a push token, since push brings the alert), station info and walking
   position 2 min, car parks 2 min. Ask for longer gaps when the data changes slowly. The phone's own Last way home
   reminder: an app poll every 60 s that does nothing without a reminder, and with one asks live times every 5 min
   (every minute in the last 25 min), only while the app is open (docs/LAST-WAY-HOME.md). Weekend trackwork on the
   current server: one `/api/alerts` read per line (at most 6), kept 30 min; the Thursday heads up reads at most every
   6 hours while Home is open (docs/TRACKWORK.md). Plan B on Home makes no request (docs/PLAN-B.md).
5. **Location.** Foreground only ("When In Use"); no background location, no geofencing (a test checks).
   Use `getLastKnownPositionAsync` first (up to 2 minutes old is fine for nearby stops and walking minutes), then
   `getCurrentPositionAsync` with `Accuracy.Balanced` (about 100 m: wifi and cell, little GPS). Never `High`,
   `Highest` or `BestForNavigation` (a test checks). The live trip map watch is Balanced, every 10 s or 30 m, and
   runs only while the live trip screen is on view with the app in front.
6. **Screen wake lock** only on the full screen board, taken on focus and released on blur (a test checks). Since 25 Oct the board checks for the native keep awake module first (`requireOptionalNativeModule('ExpoKeepAwake')`) and skips the wake lock on a build without it. Where trains stop after the station is read once per service (`/api/service`, at most 3 at a time, kept for the session), not polled.
7. **Why it's late** asks `/api/alerts?q=<line>` only when a screen's own live data shows a late, cancelled or changed service with linked alerts, once per line, kept 3 min; no timer of its own ([WHY-LATE.md](WHY-LATE.md)).
7. **Background.** Nothing in JS runs in the background. The lock screen trip card is moved by server push
   (build 205), not by the app waking up. UIBackgroundModes stays empty unless a feature truly needs one (a test
   checks app.json).
8. **Network.** Reads go through `req` in src/lib/api.ts, which shares a request already in flight for the same
   address and reuses a good answer for 4 s (src/lib/pollCore.ts `createReadCache`). `refresh=1` reads always go
   out. Any write empties the cache. Every request has a timeout (20 s default); reads get one quiet retry on a
   network error, writes never retry on their own.

## Smoothness

1. Long lists use `FlatList` (Ask, new trip). Short fixed lists inside a ScrollView (departures, up to about 40
   rows) are fine when each row is memoised.
2. Rows that show a countdown are memoised on what they show: `DepartureRow` redraws only when its data, watch
   state, note or the countdown text changes (`countdownKey` in src/lib/format.ts). Callbacks passed to memoised
   rows must only use values the row compares, or read the latest value at tap time (`store.watchedId`).
3. No heavy work in render: sort, filter and group in `useMemo` keyed on the data, not on `now`.
4. Images: SF Symbols and Material icons, no large bitmaps. Size any new image to its slot.
5. Startup: the first screen waits only for the profile and the cached config (both on the phone). Everything
   else loads after first paint. Web export splits every screen into its own chunk.

## Responsiveness

1. Every tappable thing shows it was pressed: iOS dims or highlights (`pressed` style), Android ripples.
2. Hit targets at least 44 x 44 pt on iOS and 48 x 48 dp on Android; small icons get `hitSlop`.
3. `Button` (src/components/ui.tsx) shows a spinner and ignores taps while the promise its onPress returns is
   pending, so no request is sent twice. Use it, or a `busy` state, for every action that talks to the server.
4. Every async action has a loading state, an error the person can read, and a timeout.
5. Haptics only where the HIG suggests: selection changes, success of a real action, warnings. Not on every tap.
6. Every Pressable has an `accessibilityRole` and a label when it has no text.

## Checking

* `npm test` (battery.test.mjs among them) and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
* Tap sweep: build the web export, serve it, run the sweep script from the audit (every tappable thing on each
  screen at 390 x 844 is tapped once and must do something).
